# trade-strategy-engine

This will be a trade assistant providing running analysis of different markets and assets classes to aid in identifying trends that may not be evident through traditional tools and analysis strategies. A machine learning component will be utilized to provide an unbiased basis for the strategies, but with an initial set of parameters defined by the traditional analyses. With this basis, the application will be given the ability to ascertain the traditional viewpoint, and imply to the user points of divergence from the standard models and the newly developed strategies. The process of building the strategies will be made in a series of layered "lessons" with the information contained within predefined so as to be able to identify which lessons are responsible for which assertions later down the line, and to provide the basis for measuring whether any strategy is underperforming, in line with, or outperforming the standard views.
